Undergrad project: Improving mental state recognition using different feature extraction methods

Using data generated by:
https://github.com/jordan-bird/eeg-feature-generation

We are trying to improve the feature extraction method so that we can use less features,
in order to classify the mental state of the test subject with an over 87% certainty.
